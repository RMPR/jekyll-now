title: The Open Source Way
---

I've been throught many articles, videos, etc. That cover just one topic : Opensource, one of the resources I’ve been through really impressed me and I decided to share the content:

The opensource Way is the following points:

- Openness
- Transparency
- Collaboration
- Meritocracy
- Rapid Prototyping

 All of this made me think about opensource more like a concept, a philosophy than other thing, nevertheless, what really attract me in OSS is collaboration with master in the field, 
 taking the example of Telegram’s performance, I’m always very impressed about that, and I hope that all those things will lead me to achieve what I want.
