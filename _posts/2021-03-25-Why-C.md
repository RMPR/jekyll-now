title: Why C?
---
These days I was pretty involved in some recruitement process with codeweaver (the guys working on Wine).
And even though it didn't turn out very well for me. I rediscovered what really reasonates with me as far
as computer science is concerned, and it's C programming. I mean, I genuinely enjoyed writing their 
recruitment tests (that I can't share for obvious reasons). And it meant one thing for me: I needed to go 
back to the basics (and no, it's not the [camping syndrom](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21884449)).

   > Coding in C is like camping. It's fun for a while, but eventually you really miss things like flushing toilets and grocery stores. I like using C, but I get frustrated every time I hit a wall trying to build features from other languages. C is a very WET language.

That's why I decided to have a look at [what the smart crowd thinks about the subject](https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&query=%20C%20&sort=byPopularity&type=story)
 and I ended up at first with these three recommendations:

- [Effective C: An Introduction to Professional C Programming](https://nostarch.com/Effective_C)
- [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/)
- [Learn C the hard way](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/)

Then I found [this thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22519876), then
[this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22520256) that links to 
[this wiki](http://iso-9899.info/wiki/Main_Page#Stuff_that_should_be_avoided). Needless, to say, you don't 
need anything else quite frankly, just:

1. Take a good book
2. Read it 
3. Do exercises along the way

Effective C wasn't listed but got [two very](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2020/glassborow_1952/) [good reviews](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2021/bruntlett_1959/)) which were enough for me.
I also spotted a shitton of great resources, (C Programming: A modern Approach, C Interfaces and 
Implementations: Techniques for Creating Reusable Software, ...) unfortunately, most of them didn't have 
e-book versions, I might come back to them later. Hacker News also has some 
[interesting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22865357) 
[discussions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22716068) about it.
Meanwhile I saw this post that fairly well reasonated with me
[Rust things I miss in C](https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/rust-things-i-miss-in-c.html) but
How do I manage the real life expectations (of finding a job) with my passion for
computer stuff (and low-level stuff in particular)? The solution: Learn good C (Effective C, Expert C 
 Programming is probably something I will have a peek at) practise
as much as I can, find a job leveraging that, and learn Rust along the way. Sounds good enough, so I'll
go for it.

So my dear beloved (fictionnal) readers, I'm very sorry about that, but I am switching gears, all the
"interesting posts" will stay in the backlog for a while, I will use this to learn in public and get
accountable, with that and all the whole looking for a (remote) job thing, I don't think I will have
very much time to do something else. Thanks and take care.
 
To have more insights about learning in public, you might want to have a look at [Mentorship vs. Sponsorship + Storytelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HE5LJwAv1k) by Scott Hanselman.
who explains it better than I can.
