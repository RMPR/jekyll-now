title: Why I like Open Source
---
While working on my [minimalist macro recorder](https://github.com/rmpr/atbswp), 
which was just a little thing I did [out of frustration](https://rmpr.xyz/Announcing-atbswp/).

I submitted it to r/Python, and if you don't know, r/Python is a shitshow of amateurs scripts (I won't 
  even say projects because, well, one file of Python seems more like a script to me). 
  Anyway, I posted on r/Python the first time, was
ignored, the second time it got more traction, but not quite, and I didn't get that much upvotes (which was a bit what
I wanted I admit), but I got something even more valuable, [someone](https://www.reddit.com/user/tomswirly)
not only pointed out that I need to refactor, but [how I must refactor](https://redd.it/hjul2z) 
Now it might not sound like a big deal, but I remember
[asking that question ](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/237625/translate-keyboard-inputs-to-corresponding-actions-in-pyautogui)
on code review on the stackexchange network, so whoever you are, u/TomSwirly I thank you
sincerely, I'll forever be grateful.
